/*
 * Node-Ptrace request forwarding protocol.  We send ptrace requests
 * to the nodes on the CM-5 for execution using the ptrace function in
 * the node-kernel.  The format of a request is as follows:
 *
 * [ request ] - modify memory request.  Currently the only request.
 * [ req id  ] - Uniq id for purposes of Acknowledgement.     NOTE: OUTDATED
 * [ node id ] - Node id:  0-(partition_size-1) for unique node.  
 *                         0xffffffff to broadcast to all nodes in partition
 * [ addr ]    - Memory address to modify; same as addr argument to ptrace
 * [ length  ] - Number of words of data to write
 * [ data    ]
 * [ ...     ]
 * [ data    ]
 *
 * Everything between brackets above ([...]) is one word in length.
 * Since the instrumentation controller is running on the front-end
 * (so it can really use ptrace to control the application), we can
 * assume no byte-order problems.
