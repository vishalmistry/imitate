 * COFF object files.
 * Note - this is DEC OSF/1 coff which probably isn't the real thing
 *
 * Note - this probably isn't perfect
 *      - the symbol dictionary will only map one symbol table entry to each name
 *      - I am not determining if symbols are external
 *      - I may be ignoring some useful symbols from the symbol table
 *      - I am checking the dictionary to make sure no existing entry get clobbered
 *      - I am using mmap
 *      - All of these objects need some type of "destroy" method to munmap and
 *          free memory.  This method will be invoked explictly, not implicitly.
