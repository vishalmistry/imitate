This directory contains tests for the dyninstAPI library.

To build the test programs, cd into the subdirectory of this directory that
is named after the platform you are running on, and type "make."  If you are
using the source distribution of the Dyninst API, you will need to make the
API libraries before making the tests; see the README file in the
core/dyninstAPI directory for how to do this.

Before you can run the test programs you will need to set up your
environment to use the Dyninst API library, as described in the
documentation and the README file in the directory above this one
(specifically, the DYNINSTAPI_RT_LIB environment variable should be set).

To run the tests, type "test1," "test2," etc. in the subdirectory of this
directory named after the platform you are using.  Each test program starts
a mutatee process, the executable for which must be in the current
directory.  For both programs, you should see a series of messages saying
that each test was passed.

The programs take several options:
    -verbose            Print extra output.
    -attach             Start the mutatee without using the library and then
                        attach to it.
    -run <test numbers> Run only the specified test cases.

The test2 program tests to see that various error conditions are caught
and reported properly by the library, so it is normal for it to print some
warning and error messages.  If all tests pass, it will print a message
saying so, so you may assume any error messages printed were expected.
